<h1>Evaluating Secondary Stat Scaling Models</h1>

<p><em>Author: emallson (Eisenpelz-Turalyon NA)</em></p>

<p>In <em>Battle for Azeroth,</em> Blizzard reduced the rate at which secondary stats
scale relative to prior expansions. To the best of our understanding, this
change was made in an attempt to eliminate (or at least limit) the scenarios
where it was correct to equip lower item level gear to get better stats. While
this change was mostly invisible to the average player, coming as it did during
the ilvl squish, it has been contentious among the theorycrafting community and
the general opinion is that it failed at this purpose.</p>

<p>Recently, we discovered that Blizzard had implemented new <em>diminishing returns</em>
on secondary stat scaling on the <em>Shadowlands</em> Beta. From my point-of-view, this
change reflects a misunderstanding of the impact of the BFA changes as well as a
frankly concerning willingness to layer new, opaque systems on top of an already
notoriously opaque game.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, much of my (and the wider community's) concerns are based largely
on feelycraft, not concrete analysis. As a result, this week I put together some
concrete  analysis on when it is valuable to drop ilvl for better stats under
each secondary scaling model.</p>

<h2>The Scaling Models</h2>

<p>I considered three scaling models. Technically, there is a fourth (pre-Legion)
that I could consider, which includes mainstat on jewelry. However, exact
scaling data for that time period is had to get at this point so I have omitted
it.</p>

<h3>The <em>Legion</em> Model</h3>

<p>During <em>Legion,</em> secondary stats scaled using the exact same formula as primary
stats. This is an <em>exponential</em> formula, resulting in rapid stat gains as ilvl
increases (for example: from one tier to the next).</p>

<p>Conceptually: with each ilvl increase you would gain an additional <em>percentage
of your current stats.</em> As your stats increase, the gain from adding ilvl also
increased.</p>

<h3>The <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> Model</h3>

<p>The change in <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> made secondary stats scale (approximately)
linearly.</p>

<p>Conceptually, this means that with each ilvl increase you would gain a <em>fixed
number of additional stats.</em> As your stats increase, the gain from adding ilvl
stays constant.</p>

<h3>The <em>Shadowlands</em> Model</h3>

<p>The change in <em>Shadowlands</em> adds <em>diminishing returns</em> on top of the BFA model.</p>

<p>Conceptually, this means that with each ilvl increase you gain a <em>fixed number
of additional stats</em>---but if you put too many points in an individual stat, you
effectively lose some of those points.</p>

<p>With current tuning, at low ilvls this is basically equivalent to BFA: as your
stats increase, the gain from adding ilvl stays constant. However, at higher
ilvls it changes to: as your stats increase, the gain from adding ilvl
<em>decreases.</em></p>

<p>Part of this analysis is to give an idea of <em>when</em> that change occurs.</p>

<h2>The Damage Model</h2>

<p>To evaluate damage properly, we'd need to use a tool like <em>simulationcraft.</em>
Rather than attempt to retrofit different scaling models into simc, I have
instead opted for a simplified model that should still capture much of the
behavior we are interested in.</p>

<p>Let me begin with an example: <em>Keg Smash.</em> Keg Smash is a Brewmaster Monk
ability which has its base damage determined by your <em>Attack Power</em> (defined as
<code>Agility * (1 + Mastery%)</code>). Its damage scales with versatility, increasing the
damage done per cast by <code>1 + Vers%</code>. Similarly, the average damage over many
casts increases with your critical strike, adding a factor of <code>1 + Crit%</code> over
the course of a fight. Lastly, the cooldown of Keg Smash is hasted, so the
number of casts you get over the course of a fight is increased by a factor of
<code>1 + Haste%</code>. The average damage of Keg Smash over the course of a fight is:</p>

<p><code>
number of casts * avg damage per cast = Agility * (1 + Mastery%) * (1 + Vers%) * (1 + Crit%) * (1 + Haste%)
</code></p>

<p>Not every ability scales with every stat, but this kind of scaling on key
rotational abilities is very common. I am going to use this formula, with a
small tweak, as a proxy for actual damage done over the course of a fight.
Specifically:</p>

<p><code>
Avg Damage = Mainstat * (1 + MasteryValue * Mastery%) * (1 + VersValue * Vers%) * (1 + CritValue * Crit%) * (1 + HasteValue * Haste%)
</code></p>

<p>The introduction of these <code>StatValue</code> parameters lets us model specs that scale
better or worse with particular stats. Using Brewmaster as an example again: BrM
has a fixed rotation, and so gets very limited value from Haste. Thus,
<code>HasteValue</code> would be close to 0. At the same time, Mastery doesn't impact any
of the procs that BrM (and, to a lesser extent, other tanks) have come to rely
on for damage, so it would be less valuable than either Crit or Vers.</p>

<p>Then we can estimate the gain in damage done by upgrading an item by subtracting
the <code>Avg Damage</code> for some baseline gear from the <code>Avg Damage</code> of the upgraded
gear.</p>

<p>The next question, then, is how to determine the stats in use. That process goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick a stat scaling model. For example: the BFA model.</li>
<li>Pick an average item level for your gear.</li>
<li>Generate <em>base stats</em> for your gear at that ilvl using the model.</li>
<li>Calculate <code>Avg Damage</code> using those stats. This is the <em>baseline damage.</em></li>
<li>Pick an ilvl and stat breakdown for a new item.</li>
<li>Generate the stats for that item using the model.</li>
<li>Calculate <code>Avg Damage</code> using the <em>base stats</em> plus the <em>item stats</em>. This is the <em>upgraded damage.</em></li>
<li>Calculate the <em>value of the upgrade</em> with <code>upgraded damage - baseline damage</code></li>
</ol>

<p>We can repeat this process with different items at different ilvls and stat
breakdowns to figure out when it is valuable to drop ilvl in order to improve
stats.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p><img src="./results/main_even.png" alt="Chestpiece, Even Stats and Weights" title="" /></p>

<p>The main question we want to answer is this: should you equip an item that just
dropped? The chart above shows when it is beneficial to equip an item that has
dropped with various different ilvls and stat breakdowns.</p>

<p>Obviously, <em>Legion</em> didn't have raid loot dropping between 385 and 475 and
neither will <em>Shadowlands.</em> However, since the formulas for each model are known
we can take the "what-if" scenario for a 4-tier expansion using BFA's ilvls.</p>

<p>Note that <em>most</em> items in modern WoW have two stats on them. You'll get a
Crit/Haste piece or a Mastery/Vers piece, and only rarely a pure-Crit or
Crit/Haste/Mastery/Vers piece. The items that are generated for this use two
stats (either your best two or worst two) in one of several combinations.</p>

<p>Your best and worst stats are determined by calculating which stats have the
largest gain per point relative to your equipped gear. (Technically: this is
done via automatic gradient calculation)</p>

<p>For example: the top-left section of the grid uses your two best stats in a
50/50 split. As you move right, the skew gets more extreme until you hit the 5th
box and we switch over to items with your worst stats.</p>

<p>This chart in particular shows that for each system, if you have even stats and
balanced gear you should always take an ilvl upgrade. This is the kind of
behavior that the devs have stated they're looking for.</p>

<p>Main-slot pieces like chest and legs are fairly stable. Even with fairly large
skew on your stats, it is virtually never valuable to drop ilvl under any model.</p>

<p><img src="./results/main_skewed_both.png" alt="Chestpiece, Skewed Both" title="" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, when you have heavily skewed secondary values but balanced stats,
it <em>can</em> be worth dropping ilvl on main pieces---but only under the BFA and
Shadowlands models.</p>

<p><img src="./results/main_skewed_secondaries.png" alt="Chestpiece, Skewed Weights" title="" /></p>

<p>Most specs won't have heavily skewed secondaries, though, and this effect
dissappears with more typical skews.</p>

<p>This pattern appears to remain constant on pieces that have mainstat (so:
everything but rings---we aren't touching trinkets here).</p>

<h3>The Ring Problem</h3>

<p>Rings, though. Rings get <em>wild.</em></p>

<p>Lets start off with an easy one: your stats are all equally valuable, and your
gear has balanced stats. That means you should always take ilvl on rings, right?
Well...</p>

<p><img src="./results/ring_even.png" alt="Ring, Even" title="" /></p>

<p>In <em>Legion,</em> you would have gone with ilvl in all but the most extreme cases.
From BFA onward, though, it is often worth dropping ilvl (especially in later
tiers). The only difference between <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> and <em>Shadowlands</em> is
that taking items extremely skewed towards one stat stops being worth dropping
ilvl for in later tiers.</p>

<p><img src="./results/ring_skewed-slight_both.png" alt="Ring, Slight Skew Both" title="" /></p>

<p>When you have skewed gear <em>and</em> slightly skewed secondaries, it becomes clear
that the <em>BFA</em> changes were counterproductive and that the <em>Shadowlands</em> changes
are not going to improve the situation. In fact: the only expansion where you'd
still equip a +30 ilvl ring with your worst stats on it is <em>Legion.</em></p>

<p>Let's take a moment to return to another time: 2015. Hellfire Citadel has
released, and inside you can find rings that would seem out-of-place in modern
WoW. Why? Well, they have primary stat on them. In fact, rings in Warlords (and
possibly prior, this is hard to tell) were identically scaled to bracers now. As
a result, we can check what the results look like for bracers and see how things
would behave if the WoD change (removing mainstat from rings) were reverted:</p>

<p><img src="./results/bracers_skewed-slight_both.png" alt="Bracers, Slight Skew Both" title="" /></p>

<p>Keep in mind that the <em>Legion</em> section here is actually identical to <em>Warlords</em>
ring scaling. This, in fact, is the behavior that Blizzard states they would
like to see on gear now: it is always correct to equip ilvl upgrades, and never
correct to equip ilvl downgrades. Further, this behavior holds <em>even when your
stats are heavily skewed!</em></p>

<p><img src="./results/bracers_skewed_both.png" alt="Bracers, Skew Both" title="" />
<img src="./results/bracers_skewed_secondaries.png" alt="Bracers, Skew Weights" title="" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, when you reduce the ilvl gap between items, the problem appears
again under all models. Note that this only occurs in practice due to
Warforging, which indicates that the frequency with which people dropped ilvls
for better stats in <em>Legion</em> and <em>BFA</em> may, in fact, be a byproduct of the
Warforging/Titanforging system giving use many items with small gaps between
them.</p>

<p><img src="./results/bracers_skewed-slight_both_reduced-penalty.png" alt="Bracers, Skew Both, Reduced Penalty Range" title="" /></p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>There are two main points that I'd like to make with this post. First: if
Blizzard wants to fix the ring problem, all they need to do is add mainstat to
rings. In fact, we could go back to the system in Legion with much higher
secondary values than we have now and still live in a world where you virtually
never drop ilvl for stats <em>if</em> they put mainstat back on rings.</p>

<p>Second---and more important, in my opinion---is that adding diminishing returns
to secondary stats doesn't appear to solve a problem. It doesn't meaningfully
change the decision-making process for evaluating gear. In fact, the only
scenarios I can think of where the DRs would actually change things are: (1) a
return of stat amp corruption (please, for the love of god, do <strong>not</strong> do
this!), or (2) stacking items that give very large procs of single secondary
stat.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are very real downsides to introducing yet another
opaque system---especially after BFA introduced the awful K-scaling system for
resetting tank power every tier. These opaque systems make it harder for players
to understand <em>why</em> you should or should not equip an item. They make it harder
for players to explore the game and how the different pieces interact---a key
part (IMO) of the CRPG experience.</p>

<p>Every time a new system is introduced that is described nowhere in game, that
has no discernable impact unless you know what to look for, and that has
potentially major impacts on player decisions should need <em>strong</em>
justifications to be added to the game. I don't see how the secondary DR system
satisfies these conditions, given that all it can really do (absent a return of
corruption) is screw over people that equip two big stat proc trinkets.</p>

<p>So, to end: I'd ask that this secondary DR system be scrapped entirely. Really,
I'd like a return to the Legion system (with or without mainstat on rings). The
slow crawl of secondary stat gain over the course of BFA was not fun, and
combined with the hard resets on tank power every tier made the whole thing feel
very same-y. As if I were still progressing Uldir when I was killing N'zoth.
That seems out of scope for an expansion that launches in under two months, but
perhaps could be part of 10.0.</p>
